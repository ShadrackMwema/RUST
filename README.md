# Rust Learning Repository

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! Here, I document my journey in learning Rust programming language. This repository contains the assignments I've completed and the basics I've learned.

## Basics Learned

- Variables and mutability
- Control flow (if expressions, loops)
- Data types (integers, floats, booleans)
- Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- Functions and methods
- Error handling with Result type
- Writing tests

Feel free to explore the assignments and code samples to see how I've applied these concepts in practice.
